\section{Conclusion }~\label{sec:conclusion}


With the exception that the Infinite norm and the Manhattan norm are considered together, the suggested distance measure is similar to other forms of coupling distance measurements, such as the Frechet distance. We proposed a trajectory-anonymisation heuristic approach that generates clusters with low intra-cluster distance and satisfies trajectory k-anonymity to show the suitability of our distance calculation.
